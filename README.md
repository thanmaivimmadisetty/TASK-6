‚òÅÔ∏è Task 6: Host and Deploy a Web Application on the Cloud

üéØ Objective

The aim of this task is to deploy a static web application (a simple HTML-based website) on a cloud platform, making it accessible publicly through the internet.
This helps in understanding cloud hosting, public access configuration, and web deployment using services like AWS S3.


---

üß∞ Tools Used

Amazon Web Services (AWS S3) ‚Äì For hosting the static website

VS Code / Notepad ‚Äì For creating the HTML file

Web Browser ‚Äì To test and verify the website

AWS Console ‚Äì For managing the bucket and configuration



---

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

Step 1: Create Project Folder

A new folder was created on the local computer named ‚Äúmy-cloud-demo-website‚Äù to store the HTML files for deployment.

Step 2: Create a Simple Web Page

A basic HTML file named index.html was created with the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Cloud App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello Cloud!</h1>
  <p>This is my first web app hosted on the cloud.</p>
</body>
</html>

This file serves as the home page of the web app.

Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket

Logged in to the AWS Management Console.

Opened Amazon S3 and clicked on Create bucket.

Gave a unique name (e.g., my-cloud-demo-website) and selected a region (e.g., us-east-1).

Left default settings and created the bucket successfully.


Step 4: Upload Website Files

Opened the created bucket ‚Üí Upload section.

Uploaded the index.html file into the bucket.

Confirmed that the file appeared under the Objects tab.


Step 5: Enable Static Website Hosting

Opened the Properties tab of the bucket.

Scrolled down to Static website hosting and clicked Edit.

Selected Enable ‚Üí chose Host a static website.

Set Index document: index.html.

Saved the settings and copied the Website endpoint URL provided by AWS.


Step 6: Set Public Permissions

Went to the Permissions tab.

Disabled ‚ÄúBlock all public access‚Äù to allow visitors to view the website.

Added a Bucket Policy allowing public read access:


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-cloud-demo-website/*"
    }
  ]
}

Saved the policy to make all files inside the bucket publicly accessible.

Step 7: Test the Hosted Web App

Copied the Website endpoint from the Static website hosting section.

Opened the link in a browser ‚Äî the webpage displayed ‚ÄúHello Cloud!‚Äù, confirming successful deployment.

Took screenshots showing:

The live website in the browser

The AWS S3 bucket console with hosting enabled

üß† Outcome

By completing this task:

A static web app was successfully hosted and deployed on AWS Cloud.

The app is now accessible publicly through a cloud-generated URL.

Gained practical understanding of:

Creating and managing AWS S3 buckets

Setting permissions and bucket policies

Hosting and testing static web content online
